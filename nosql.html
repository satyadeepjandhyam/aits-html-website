                  Proprietary NoSQL with MongoDB and DynamoDB database
                </h2>
                <p>
                  An open-source document database, MongoDB is the most popular
                  NoSQL database. C++ is the programming language of choice for
                  MongoDB. This lesson is a wonderful place to start for those
                  interested in building a high-performance database—people who
                  want to learn MongoDB clearly and straightforwardly.

          <h3>MongoDB</h3>
          <p>
            MongoDB ideas will be explained in this lesson, and you'll be able
            to progress to a higher degree of competence after finishing it. If
            you need to support quick iterative development, MongoDB is a good
            solution. Allow for a huge number of teams to work together. Read
            and write traffic should be able to withstand high levels of demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your data repository should be able to handle huge amounts of data.
            As the business evolves, so should the type of deployment. Search
            and save data in many formats, including text, geographical, and
            time series. It is because of these traits that MongoDB has
            flourished as a business.
          </p>
          <h3>Why Use MongoDB?</h3>
          <p>
            With MongoDB, developers can build scalable applications with
            dynamic data schemas since it is designed on a scale-out
            architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            With MongoDB, developers may store structured and unstructured data
            in the same database. It stores documents in a JSON-like manner.
            This format is a no-brainer for developers because it is mapped
            directly to the native objects when it comes to current programming
            languages. Additionally, MongoDB can manage massive volumes of data
            and can be scaled both vertically and horizontally.
          </p>
          <p>
            MongoDB was designed for developers of web and enterprise
            applications who want a database that can grow and change gracefully
            as their applications do. MongoDB is used by businesses of all sizes
            for several reasons.
          </p>
          <h3>DynamoDB</h3>
          <h4>Very Fast</h4>
          <p>
            DynamoDB, for particular, was created to handle a massive increase
            of data. When it comes to Amazon Web Services (AWS) database
            systems, DynamoDB is one of the most popular options. Using
            DynamoDB, customers may benefit from auto-scaling, in-memory
            caching, and backup and restore options for their internet-scale
            applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            To maintain track of expired data, developers can use this feature.
            This is due to the fact that DynamoDB streams give a time-ordered
            history of changes made to the data in the last 24 hours. Streams
          </p>
          <h4>Benefits of DynamoDB for Operations</h4>
          <p>
            Those who have worked in the information technology business are
            aware that growing databases can be both challenging and dangerous.
            DynamoDB has the ability to auto-scale by keeping track of how close
            your consumption is to the top boundaries of the available
            resources. This can allow your system to react in response to the
            quantity of data flow, allowing you to prevent performance
            difficulties while also lowering your expenditures.
          </p>
          <h4>Access to control rules</h4>
          <p>
            It becomes increasingly necessary to maintain effective access
            control as information grows more particular and personal. You want
            to be able to apply access control to the appropriate persons
            without generating bottlenecks in the workflow of other users. By
            using DynamoDB's fine-grained access control, the table owner may
            acquire a greater level of control over the data contained within
            the database.
          </p>
          <h4>Time To Live</h4>
          <p>
            Setting timestamps for deleting old data from your tables is a
            feature known as TTL or Time-to-Live. Expiring data is removed from
            the table as soon as a timestamp has expired. In addition to
            lowering storage space and minimising the expenses of manual data
            erasure, this approach also helps.
          </p>
          <h4>Storage of inconsistent schema items</h4>
          <p>
            DynamoDB can handle inconsistent schema storage for your data
            objects. Because it is a NoSQL database, DynamoDB is better able to
            deal with query volumes and delivers high speed queries for item
            storage in inconsistent schemas because of its ability to handle
            less structured data more effectively than a relational database.

          <h3>DIFFERENT WAY TO USE FIGMA</h3>
          <p>
            Not only in developing sectors, even in many sectors like gaming and
            dancing spots, but Figma plays a crucial role. Apart from making
            work easy and smooth for the team of designing of developing
            graphics sector other sectors are even coming up. All sectors of
            gaming are coming up.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The tea in which Figma is working has a great capacity to organise
              a huge range of information in a very short time. This method is
              usually can be created by an affinity diagram. Even the
              multiplayer will help to throw ideas into the file in tandem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Figma has an option to choose and vote for the concepts which are
              different in real-time. This is because of the best and latest
              version which Figma is having with. The entire choice of making a
              logo or designing always keeps the capacity of catching the
              attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sometimes, it is not easy to make the line of the design to make
              the line or design divide and even conquer those designs by an
              assembly line. Even the members can do this work by just making
              splitting up on very large tasks.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h3>USES OF FIGMA FOR DEVELOPING GRAPHICS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Figma can be worked on any platform based on or run by web
              applications or browsers. Many platforms are there like macs,
              Windows PCs, machines of Linux, and Chromebooks which can be even
              come into use with Figma.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the Figma is based on the browser, the teams can easily
              collaborate as they will be presented as the Docs of Google. With
              the help of this software, a design can be checked to see whether
              the designs are in real-time or not. It can be checked by just
              opening a shared file
            </li>
            <li>
              Sometimes the communication among the team members are not taken
              place due to various reasons. This leads to a huge loss. To avoid
              such losses, Figma uses Slack which is meant for communication
              purposes. Whenever the channel of Figma is created, the designs
              can be sacked by the team.
